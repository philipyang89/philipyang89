## Projects
Mainly some websites I have done for class or games that I like.

🎮 [Hades](https://philipyang89.github.io/hades): Made in March 2024 as my final assignment for my HTML/CSS course.  
🔧 [Hades 2](https://hades2.onrender.com): Started in May 2025 as the final web degree project, a wikipedia site demonstrating  
back-end proficiency and built with Remix.js (a React full-stack framework) using Tailwind v4 style.
