👋 Hi! I'm Xun Philip, a full-stack web developer.  
💙 My goal is to eventually become a software engineer and turn ideas into reality.  
🌏 I'm a chinese born in Spain.  
⚙️ Currently working in Essen, Germany.  

## Projects
Mainly some websites I have done for class or games that I like.

🥖 [Bakery](https://philipyang89.github.io/buen-horno): Finished February 2025 for my web interface design course.  
🎮 [Hades](https://philipyang89.github.io/hades): Made in March 2024 as my final assignment for my HTML/CSS course.  
🔧 Hades 2 [**Current Project**]: The idea is to dive deeper into the backend and fetch data linked to a database in some sort of way.  

All repositories can be found publicly on my profile.
